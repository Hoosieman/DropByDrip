### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for drink selection.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different devices, use of company logo to show familiarity.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login,drink choices, applying drink changes, show last purchased drink, backend endpoint calls.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving previous drinks
  - inputing options
  - drink suggestions
- **DB** - Store users, drink choices, and orders in database.
- **Login** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. no orders without account
- **WebSocket** - Ability to shout out your favorite drink to other users
- **React** - Application ported to use the React web framework.

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Two HTML page that represent the ability to login and vote.
- **Links** - The login page automatically links to the drinks selection page. This page showing all soda addition options.
- **Text** - Each of the soda options item is represented by a description.
- **Images** - Use of the company logo for branding
- **Login** - Input box and submit button for login.
- **Database** - The drink options represent data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - Able to see realtime updates of users favorite drink order.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- **Header, footer, and main content body**
- **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- **Application images** - Still don't have images and so no styling here. ðŸ˜”

## JavaScript deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented by JavaScript so that the application works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- **login** - login takes you to the "house favorites" page of sodas
- **database** - stores info about the most ordered drink by users
- **WebSocket** - 
- **application logic** - If a user selects a certain soda, suggested adons for that soda pop up
